It is beautiful because it is a bunch of EA-affiliated people independently coming to the conclusion that total authoritarianism is necessary to prevent what in their eyes is the threat AI poses to all of humanity. Since this sounds like an exaggeration, I will quote verbatim, or rather post screenshots verbatim, for most of this article.\\n\\nThe crux of the argument: AI creates so much innovation that it can‚Äôt be controlled top-down.\\n\\nThey predictably call for exactly the kind of regulatory capture most convenient to OpenAI, Deepmind, and other large players. They list some costs and benefits here. All of the citations about positive examples of AI are demonstrations of AI in the real world, all of the negative citations are just their own hypothetical scenarios constructed with no basis in reality.\\n\\nRemember how they said earlier that it‚Äôs hard to define or prove harm, only the ‚Äúpossibility‚Äù of harm? That‚Äôs the key to the coming crackdown. At this point everyone in the audience should be aware that these are not just powerless academics, these are members of think tanks, government agencies, companies, and corporate boards with real power.\\n\\nRe 1: the limiting factor of designing new biological weapons is equipment, safety, and not killing yourself with them.\\n\\nRe 2: Not just wrong but the complete opposite of the truth. Based on an incorrect understand of the legacy press.\\n\\nRe 3: Cyberattacks resulting from machine learning adoption are real, but far from catastrophic. Think of the argument: people‚Äôs ML algorithms will be hacked and become worse than not having the ML algorithm at all? Does anyone believe this circular argument about any technology?\\n\\nRe 4: The footnote is just linking to their hypotheticals again, no real examples.\\n\\nAt What Cost?\\n\\nI‚Äôll start this section off with praise: they have put together an actual plan that would indeed put AI companies under government control. This is a competent crackdown strategy. It would work if not stopped by legislators, voters, or courts.\\n\\nAdditionally, targeting AI companies and hardware companies, at least doesn‚Äôt include normal users. I say this to contrast with the ‚ÄúAI Ethics‚Äù crowd who want to crack down on AI output, which is indistinguishable from the writing and art of normal people. Consequently, their preferred crackdown is completely indistinguishable from total crackdowns on normal people‚Äôs freedoms of speech and association. I say this to give EAs a bit of context, since they tend to ally themselves with people who would be far, far worse than themselves.\\n\\nThat being said, this will nonetheless be extremely economically destructive. Additionally, as we‚Äôve seen with social media censorship, drug relations, or civil rights law, this can easily end in the regulatory state capturing the companies themselves and deputizing them to censor or otherwise attack individuals.\\n\\nThey lay out the three key problems:\\n\\nIf you pause for a moment and read the lines carefully, you will realize they are all synonyms for freedom. An equivalent reading:\\n\\nThe Unexpected Capabilities Problem: ML is easily used to create innovation.\\n\\nThe Deployment Safety Problem: ML is easy to update and build upon.\\n\\nThe profileration problem: People have the first amendment right to share ML.\\n\\nThis diagram is amazing because it‚Äôs just directly advocating for regulatory capture. This looks like a diagram set up by Theodore Roosevelt-style trust busters to criticize concentrated monopolies and their influence on politics. This is what the authors of the paper are directly advocating for. In case this wasn‚Äôt clear they also directly say they want regulatory capture in the next paragraph:\\n\\nI said earlier that their plans are less totalitarian than those of the ‚ÄúAI Ethics‚Äù scam artists, but they are apparently not opposed to working with them. Other than that this is classic entrenchment of political constituencies ‚Äì subsidizing people who ideologically loyal with taxpayer dollars.\\n\\nAny endorsement of the EU crackdown strategy should be immediately rejected by any remotely sane American politician. I have an article in Pirate Wires criticizing the broader framework of crackdowns as China-lite and in some cases China-mega, if you want article-length treatment of this topic.\\n\\nMy normal style is to do more legislative forecasting and give a broader understanding of what measures are likely to be worsened by political coalitions, but with this paper I don‚Äôt even feel that is necessary. I guess we should thank EAs for saying the quiet part out loud: ‚ÄúTotalitarian crackdowns are necessary, we want to unify all companies through regulatory capture, freedom is the enemy and must be eliminated‚Äù all in one paper.\\n\\nI expect one category of reply because I\\'ve already encountered it in real life: \"But Brian, the article is correct, if we don\\'t do totalitarianism we\\'ll all die!\"\\n\\nIf you want the direct arguments, start here:',\n",

       "  'content': 'In a previous post we talked about Natural Language framework. It\\'s a powerful tool for text analysis, but it currently supports only a limited set of languages. In this post, we will learn how to create our own machine learning model for sentiment analysis for new languages. Without a single line of code. Well, almost üòè.\\n\\nUsing Create ML\\n\\nCreate ML is a tool that helps you train models for image classification, object detection, sound or text classification, etc. If you have Xcode installed, you already have Create ML, it\\'s a part of the Xcode app bundle. You can find it in the Xcode menu -> Open Developer Tool -> Create ML . The final result of working with Create ML is a Core ML model. It can be integrated into your app and run on the simulators or the devices.\\n\\nCreate ML has different project templates. There are two types of the templates for text:\\n\\nText classification. Identifying the main topic, theme, or sentiment in text;\\n\\nWord tagging. Splitting text into classified phrases or words based on their context.\\n\\nWe\\'ll create a sentiment analysis model for Russian and Kazakh languages. Let\\'s choose the Text classification template and call it SentimentTextClassifier . You can also add author name, license and description for your model. The next step is to choose a dataset. You can use your own dataset or download one from the internet. For example, you can find sentiment datasets on Kaggle or HuggingFace. I didn\\'t find good datasets for my languages, so I created my own by generating sample texts with ChatGPT. It\\'s a JSON file with the following structure:\\n\\n[ { // means \\'Today was a wonderful day, I managed to do everything I planned!\\' \"text\" : \"–°–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è –±—ã–ª –∑–∞–º–µ—á–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å, —è —É—Å–ø–µ–ª –≤—Å—ë, —á—Ç–æ –∑–∞–ø–ª–∞–Ω–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–ª!\" , \"label\" : \"positive\" }, ... { // means \\'It was an ordinary day at work, nothing special happened.\\' \"text\" : \"–ù–∞ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–µ –±—ã–ª –æ–±—ã—á–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å, –±–µ–∑ –æ—Å–æ–±—ã—Ö —Å–æ–±—ã—Ç–∏–π.\" , \"label\" : \"neutral\" }, ... { // means \\'At work, I was blamed for something I didn\\'t do.\\' \"text\" : \"–ñ“±–º—ã—Å—Ç–∞ –º–µ–Ω—ñ –∂–∞—Å–∞–º–∞“ì–∞–Ω —ñ—Å–∫–µ –∫—ñ–Ω”ô–ª–∞–¥—ã.\" , \"label\" : \"negative\" } ]\\n\\nAlso, you can use CSV files or use matching folders with text files:\\n\\nTraining Data ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Positive ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dataset1.txt ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dataset2.txt ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Negative ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dataset3.txt ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dataset4.txt\\n\\nOptionally, you can split your dataset into training and validation parts. If you leave the validation data empty, Create ML will do it for you.\\n\\nThe last step is to choose the algorithm. Create ML supports different algorithms for text classification:\\n\\nMaximum entropy;\\n\\nConditional random field;\\n\\nTransfer learning static embeddings;\\n\\nTransfer learning ELMo embeddings;\\n\\nTransfer learning BERT embeddings.\\n\\nThe only algorithm that supports multilingual models is BERT embeddings. It\\'s a powerful model that can be used for a wide range of tasks. In two words, it\\'s a model that learns bi-directional representations of text to significantly improve contextual understanding. BERT embedding models are available from iOS 17.0+ deployment target.\\n\\nNext, we\\'ll choose the language family. In our case, it\\'s Cyrillic for Bulgarian, Kazakh, Russian, and Ukrainian languages. Now we\\'re ready to go, just press the Train button.\\n\\nAfter training, you can see the training results of the model. It shows the training and validation accuracy:\\n\\nGood dataset quality is crucial for the model. If you have a small dataset, you can use data augmentation. It\\'s a technique that generates new data from existing data. For example, you can replace words with synonyms, or change the order of words in the sentence. My accuracy is good enough, so let\\'s check the model in Preview tab. I\\'ll use an example: \"I finished the article and I\\'m so happy\". Here is the result for Russian language:\\n\\nAnd the same example for Kazakh language:\\n\\nIt\\'s definitely a positive sentiment, and the model works as expected. The last step is to save the model. In Output tab you can theck the model parameters and save it with Get button:\\n\\nWe get SentimentTextClassifier.mlmodel file which can be integrated into your app. The dataset size is 46 Kb, and the model size is 1.4 Mb, if you\\'re wondering.\\n\\nIntegrating Core ML model in iOS app\\n\\nIntegration is very simple. Just drag and drop the .mlmodel file into your Xcode project. Xcode will automatically generate a Swift class with a convenience interface. Here is the code for sentiment analysis:\\n\\nenum Sentiment : String { case positive = \"positive\" case neutral = \"neutral\" case negative = \"negative\" } func sentiment ( for text: String ) -> Sentiment ? { do { let classifier = try SentimentTextClassifier () let output = try classifier. prediction ( text : text) return Sentiment ( rawValue : output.label) } catch { print (error) return nil } }\\n\\nFuthermore, you can use Preview right in Xcode, just select the imported model and tap Preview tab.\\n\\nSpeed of the model is also important. You can check the performance of the model in Performance tab. It shows the timings for different devices:\\n\\nPerformance reports may be exported in .mlperf format. It\\'s a JSON file with a specific structure. You can use it for further analysis or sharing with your team.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nCreate ML is easy to use and doesn\\'t require deep knowledge in machine learning. The only thing you need is a good dataset. It\\'s a good start point for creating machine learning models for your apps. In a real-world scenario, you may need to improve the model with more data. Luckily, you\\'re not limited to use UI interface, you can use CoreML framework and train updated models with Swift code. Even more, you can use popular ML frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch and convert models to Core ML format with Core ML Tools.\\n\\nThat was the last post in the series about text analysis. I hope you enjoyed it and learned something new. As usual you can find the final project with the dataset and the model on Github. Feel free to ask questions or share your feedback on X.

It's reliable.\\n\\nalready used and proven in Microsoft products like Xbox and Bing search. It's reliable.

This means teams can share a workspace and collaborate with each other from everywhere. Azure ML supports the two main machine learning languages: R and Python . If you know how to write R or Python, it makes it easy to bring your code into the cloud.\\n\\n. If you know how to write R or Python, it makes it easy to bring your code into the cloud. The output of Azure ML can be viewed in many familiar tools, including Power BI, Excel, web browser, PowerPoint, mobile applications and more. If you‚Äôre interested in this area, keep an eye out for future posts, where I‚Äôll get into the detail of connecting Azure ML to other tools (see diagram below).\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\nHow Azure Machine Learning can be helpful\\n\\nAzure ML supports three different types of analysis: descriptive analysis, predictive analysis and prescriptive analysis.\\n\\nWhile data is everywhere, actionable intelligence from data is harder to find. Our customers want to use their data to drive reinvention of business processes. To do this it needs to be easier to analyse data ‚Äì to get from ‚Äúwhat happened‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy it happened‚Äù to prediction: ‚Äúwhat will happen‚Äù and ultimately, know ‚Äúhow to make it happen‚Äù.\\n\\nAs the chart below shows, predictive and prescriptive analysis are more difficult, but they provide greater future value.\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\nDescriptive analysis (What‚Äôs happening? Or, what happened?)\\n\\nDescriptive analysis allows you to see the current trend, behaviour and structure of data ‚Äì you analyse data in order to summarise what happened. The majority of business analytics - such as sales reports, web metrics, and social networks analysis - are descriptive .\\n\\nOne of the main approaches to descriptive analysis is to classify the data into different clusters using the K-Means clustering algorithm (Figure 4).\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\nClustering algorithms are mostly used for answering questions such as:\\n\\nWhich other customers have similar preferences to this one?\\n\\nWhat is a natural way to divide this set of customers into groups?\\n\\nWhich viewers like the same kind of movies?\\n\\nWhat are the most common patterns in petrol price changes?\\n\\nWhat is a natural way to break this set of companies up into groups?\\n\\nPredictive Analysis (What will happen?)\\n\\nPredictive analytics is all about understanding the future. Predictive analytics provides actionable insights based on data, through estimates about the likelihood of a future outcome, based on probabilities. Although of course it is important to remember that no statistical algorithm can ‚Äúpredict‚Äù the future with 100% certainty.\\n\\nOther posts on our tech blog about predictive analysis:\\n\\nData science: more than just analysis (an overview of data science, predictive and prescriptive analytics)\\n\\nHow to train your inbox using Microsoft Azure Machine Learning (part one, two and three)\\n\\nCortana Analytics Suite: first look\\n\\nPredictive analysis has been used for marketing, finance, maintenance, operational efficiency, energy forecasting, text and speech processing, image processing and computer vision, and so forth. Azure ML provides predefined algorithms that help us to make predictions more easily.\\n\\nThe following types of questions can be answered using predictive algorithms:\\n\\nWhen will this part fail?\\n\\nWill my customer leave me for a competitor?\\n\\nWill this customer renew their subscription?\\n\\nShould this customer receive a promotional offer?\\n\\nHow likely is this person to make a purchase?\\n\\nDoes this applicant pose an acceptable credit risk?\\n\\nHow many bikes will be rented in the next hour?\\n\\nWhat will the consumer demand be in this region over the next month?\\n\\n\\u200dPredictive analytics: Classifications and Regression Algorithms in Azure ML\\n\\n\\u200d\\n\\nPrescriptive Analysis (How we can make it happen?)\\n\\nPrescriptive analysis is the best way to see how to make a sale or encourage a customer in the future. Recommendation systems are the another name for prescriptive analysis. Customer activity is used to recommend items and improve conversion in the digital store. The history of previous purchases and interests are used to recommend new products. To make the recommendation we employ both descriptive and predictive analysis several times.\\n\\nOne of the famous recommendation systems is Amazon. Once a person purchases something from Amazon, Amazon recommends other products based on the similarity of the items purchased and the similarity of the customer profile to other customers. We name the first approach Content-Based Filtering and the later one Collaborative Filtering.\\n\\nAzure ML proposes some APIs that can be customised to support recommendation (prescriptive analysis). Microsoft Azure ML‚Äôs recommendations include Item to Item recommendations - a customer who bought this also bought that - and Customer to Item recommendations: a customer like you also bought that.\\n\\nExisting Azure ML modules can be used to do these experiments (see figure below). In future posts we will also explain how to create a recommendation package in Azure ML.\\n\\nMicrosoft Azure ML is a part of Cortana Intelligence that provides a facility for data scientists, business intelligence experts, and software developers to get insight out of data. Azure ML provides some predefined algorithms for users who are not familiar with machine learning algorithms. Also, it provides a facility for data scientists to use their own code in the cloud. Working with Azure ML is easy and users can create web service from their models. Azure ML supports the three main types of analytics: descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analysis.\\n\\nIn future posts, I‚Äôll explain in more detail how to create descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics in Azure ML. I‚Äôll also show how Azure ML can be connected to Power BI, R, and web applications.\",\n",
